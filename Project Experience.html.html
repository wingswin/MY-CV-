        <h1>1. Sodoku with C program</h1>
            I developed a Sudoku game using the C programming language. This game allows players to input any puzzle files they wish to play. It had 2 modes for players to choose. In easy mode, players can attempt the puzzle as many times as they like until they succeed. If a mistake is made, the game provides hints to guide the player towards the correct solution. In hard mode ,players have only three attempts to solve the puzzle.
